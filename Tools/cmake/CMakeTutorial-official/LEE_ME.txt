Tutorial: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html

The tutorial documentation and source code for examples can be found in the Help/guide/tutorial directory 
of the CMake source code tree. 

Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a starting point. 
The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step provides the complete solution for the previous step.

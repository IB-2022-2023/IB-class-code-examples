 * @brief A class with defined destructor
 *
 * When object reaches end of lifetime, typically some cleanup required before object passes out of existence
 * Destructor is member function that is automatically called when object reaches end of lifetime in order to perform any necessary cleanup
 * Often object may have allocated resources associated with it (e.g., memory, files, devices, network connections, processes/threads)
 * When object destroyed, must ensure that any resources associated with object are released
 * Destructors often serve to release resources associated with object
 * Destructor for class T always has name T:: ̃T
 * Destructor has no return type (not even void)
 * Destructor cannot be overloaded
 * Destructor always takes no parameters
 * If no destructor is specified, destructor automatically provided that calls destructor for each data member of class type
 * Sometimes, automatically provided destructor will not have correct behavior
 *
 * In this example,
 * Without explicitly-provided destructor (i.e., with destructor automatically
 * provided by compiler), memory associated with bufferPtr would not be freed
